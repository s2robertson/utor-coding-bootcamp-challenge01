# UTor Bootcamp Challenge 1: Refactoring for Accessibility

## Description
This website is a mock-up of a digital marketing company's homepage.  It is the result of an exercise in refactoring.  
The original files contained mainly `div` elements, with semantics coming only from CSS class names.  There were also 
many CSS classes that were duplicates of each other.  I refactored the page to use semantic HTML elements, condensed
the CSS, and made some improvements to the page's accessibility (adding image alt tags, making some links have larger
areas, etc.).
